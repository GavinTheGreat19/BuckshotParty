# Hello World
---
I am GavinTheGreat19, and I have developed Buckshot Party!
I was heavily inspired by the works of *Mike Klubnika*, particularly his game ***[Buckshot Roulette](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette)***.
I meant for this project to be an extension of my past one, Buckshot Counter. However, this one's scope surpassed it fairly quickly.
I decided to make it after showing my past project to my friends at school, when they took advantage of the shotgun I added on a whim, using it to play a very barebones version of Buckshot Roulette.
This inspired me to try and recreate the entire game with HTML so I could play it with my friends, so we wouldn't have to keep track of health and such in our heads.

## Features!
- 3D Graphics and Visuals, by me!
  - I made all of the graphics for this project, that probably took the most time. Hackatime doesn't track blender, but I spent around six hours making, texturing, compositing, and rendering the models themselves for use in the game.
- Three Different Play modes (2, 3 and 4)
- Individual Player Classifications
  - Different Healths
  - Different Turns (sometimes it doesn't do the thing where it switches turns, but it is purely visual and functionally irrelevant.)
- Background Music
  - Pick between *Surrounded* by *Alex Peipmen* from the Buckshot Roulette OST, and *Nocturne op.9 No.2* by *Frédéric Chopin*
- Sound Effects for like everything
  - Loading the gun, dying, shooting, starting the game, selecting players, all sorts of cool stuff. Lot of logic went into it!
- Detection for the "life" status for each player that changes the way players are handled if someone is dead or not playing.

## Features I really wanted to add but didn't have time to!
- Different Items with their own unique function:
  - **Gum**: Restore one health point.
  - **Crowbar**: Splinter the stock, Double damage for one turn.
  - **Tin Can**: Shoot the tin can, safely dispel one shell.
  - **Skip Card**: Uno, Skip a chosen player's turn.
  - **Flashlight**: look into the barrel, Reveal the next shell.
- Individual, Random player Inventories that are refilled each time the gun is loaded.

I really wanted to finish this project fully before High Seas was over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Let this be a lesson to everyone about scope and timing.
Plan your projects around the time you have, and not the time you wish you had. Focus on coding and game logic before graphics and design.
I don't know, even though I didn't *fully* finish this project, it is still a game, and a decently fun one at that.

I Hope you all enjoy my project!
